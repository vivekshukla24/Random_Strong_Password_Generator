# Random_Strong_Password_Generator

This program prints a strong random password of desired length which has a combination of :-

a) Numbers

b) Capital Letters

c) lowercase Letters

d) Special Characters

It has an in-code choice for the programmer to also ramdomise the length of the password instead of taking the input of max length by user:- 

-> Simply comment the max_len driven code and uncomment the randomized section of the code.

-> The code is set for desired max_len generation by default.
